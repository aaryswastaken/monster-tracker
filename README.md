# Monster-tracker

By @aaryswastaken

---

This whole project's goal is to track the price of certain article in my area so that I can buy them at their cheapest. It is composed into two parts:
 - `server`: the scraper that will get the different prices from the different vendors and put them into a database.
 - `web`: The web front/back-end to display & configure the item list.

## Server
